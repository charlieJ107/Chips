You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.\n\nTo make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your [username](https://telegram.org/faq#usernames-and-t-me) (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public. We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n\nWe do **not** require your screen name to be your real name. Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name. This way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured)."
